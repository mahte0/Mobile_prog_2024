//completion (or failure) of an asychronous operation and its resulting value.
//Resolve: A callback function that is used to when the promise is fulfilled.
//Reject: A callback function that is used when the promise is rejected.
//.then(): A method that is used to handle the resolved promise.
//.catch(): Amethod that is used to handle the rejected promise.
